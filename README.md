# Itinerise

Itinerise - travel itinerary generator meant to decrease travel stress and pre-trip anxiety.

# Hypothesis

The final hypothesis is based on personal experiences, beliefs, and observations, survey results from Wyndham Vacation Rentals [1], and responses to own survey:

*“Provided with a customised day-by-day itinerary on a comfortable hand-held interface, people would experience less stress during their trips and have more pleasant memories. Including secondary information tailored for said itinerary i.e. checkbox packing list, would decrease the pre-trip anxiety and relieve travellers of negative emotions and worries before their trips.”*


The above-mentioned realisation was confirmed by Wyndham Vacation Rentals survey, in which 48% of the respondents agreed a ready-made itinerary to follow would help alleviate travel stress. I observed similar results in my own survey, in which nearly 42% participants voted positively to such idea, and roughly 37% replied with a “maybe”. To sum up, nearly 80% of the people questioned would be willing to give the idea a chance.

# Aim

*“Build a mobile app allowing users to create custom day-by-day vacation itineraries to improve their travel experience, reduce stress and pre-travel anxiety.”*


The project aim is to build a mobile app that would possess a powerful filtering feature allowing to provide the user with a personal travel experience. It would filtering for special groups like: the elderly, people with disabilities, parents with children, business people, athletes etc. The app would then build a daily schedule allowing the user to strictly follow it as that would provide constant distraction – routine emulation – effective means to tackle anxiety.

# Objectives

1. Research current travel planning apps/tools and evaluate their flaws, probability to induce pre-travel anxiety.

2. Conduct market research through anonymous questionnaires to determine demand and necessary features.

3. Build a mobile app allowing the user to randomise/build an all-inclusive travel itinerary according to custom, painstaking filtering process.

4. Utilise machine learning to suggest alternative activities if the user is not following the travel itinerary.

5. Organise a user group/beta testing to determine the usefulness of the implemented model.
